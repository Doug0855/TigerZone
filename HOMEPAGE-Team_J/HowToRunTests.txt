Testing our Server-Client model implementation
1. Run the server locally by entering "./server.out 3333 < TigerZone_ServerCommands2" into the terminal
2. On another terminal run the the TigerZoneâ„¢ implementation by entering "./tiger.out localhost 3333 TIGERZONE TEAMJ IAMJ"
Note: The Challenge will end very quickly as only a few moves are executed. The mock server tests the client server communication flow logic by sending mock commands. Some of the commands are erronous and this test does not check for syntactically correct commands from either the server or client. This test will test that the Network Protocol is followed correctly.
